	abstract = {We argue that rapid accretion onto pre-main sequence stars causes the outbursts of FU Orionis objects. In our model, emission from the hot, optically thick accretion disk dominates the system light at maximum. The radial temperature gradient of the disk produces an M-type spectrum in the infrared, a G-type spectrum at optical wavelengths, and an excess below 4000 Å, as observed. The absence of detectable radial
velocity variations leads us to suggest that the accreted material comes from a surrounding protostellar nebula, rather than a companion star.  A crucial prediction of the disk model is that weak absorption lines should be double-peaked. We report high-resolution spectra of V1057 Cyg which show double-peaked profiles in red photospheric lines. Herbig and Petrov have observed a similar effect in FU On, indicating that doubled profiles are characteristic of FU Orionis objects. In principle, the double absorption might be produced by a spectroscopic binary system, but the orbital period of such a system must be short, and no evidence for velocity-crossing has yet been observed.  We further propose that the observed massive winds of FU Orionis objects arise from the luminous disk surface. The large occultation of redshifted material implied by this picture is in agreement with the meager redshifted emission observed in the Hα P Cygni profiles of these objects. Bipolar
outflows have been associated with a number of pre-main sequence stars; we point out that ejection from a disk can naturally and efficiently produce winds with the appropriate geometry.},

The early history of V1057 is examined along with its spectral classification, radial velocities, line structure, colors, dimensions, IR excesses, and associated reflection nebulae. The discovery of V1515 Cyg is discussed, spectral
characteristics and statistics of the three known FU Ori variables are evaluated, and it is suggested that the mean time between successive outbursts of the FU Ori type in an individual T Tauri star is roughly 10,000 years. Some effects of one or more FU Ori-type eruptions in the young sun on matter in the inner solar nebula are considered together with several proposed explanations for the cause of such outbursts.

	abstract = {In the 1700’s, Immanuel Kant and the Marquis de Laplace proposed that the solar system collapsed from a gaseous medium of roughly uniform density ([79], [105]). A flattened gaseous disk — the protosolar nebula — formed out of this cloud. The Sun contracted out of material at the center of the disk, while the planets condensed in the outer portions. Despite its simplicity, this model suffered from the angular momentum problem inherent to star formation: a cloud of gas and dust with the diameter of the solar system and the mass of the Sun has too much angular momentum to collapse to the Sun’s present size. It took 150 years to solve this problem. C. von Weiszäcker worked out the basic physics of a viscous accretion disk, building on previous realizations that a turbulent viscosity could move material inwards and angular momentum outwards through the protosolar nebula ([178], [179]). With Lüst’s steady-state solution ([119]), Kant’s nebular hypothesis no longer suffered from the angular momentum problem and became the leading model for solar system formation.},

It is argued that the double absorption lines observed in FU Ori and other members of the group, which have been claimed to be the signature of a self-luminous Keplerian disk, can be produced equally well by a single rotating star. The properties of the absorption-line spectrum of FU Ori as observed at a resolution of about 50,000 are described and compared to simple models of a single rotator with a stratified atmosphere. It is shown that the line structure of FU Ori can be reproduced by a model consisting of an emission-line shell overlaid by a cooler absorbing layer, the two superimposed upon a macroturbulent G-type supergiant spectrum. In the present model, the appearance of line doubling is due to the appearance of weak emission cores in the metallic absorption lines, while
curve-of-growth effects account for the observed dependence of reversal intensity upon absorption line strength.},

	abstract = {We have obtained ALMA Band 7 observations of the FU Ori outburst system at 0.6"x0.5" resolution to measure the link between the inner disk instability and the outer disk through sub-mm continuum and molecular line observations. Our observations detect continuum emission which can be well modeled by two unresolved sources located at the position of each binary component. The interferometric observations recover the entire flux reported in previous single-dish studies, ruling out the presence of a large envelope. Assuming that the dust is optically thin, we derive disk dust masses of \$2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and \$8{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, for the north and south components respectively. We place limits on the disks' radii of \$r{\textless}\$45 AU. We report the detection of molecular emission from \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CO(3-2), HCO\${\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$(4-3) and from HCN(4-3). The \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CO appears widespread across the two binary components, and is slightly more extended than the continuum emission. The denser gas tracer HCO\${\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$ peaks close to the position of the southern binary component, while HCN appears peaked at the position of the northern component. This suggests that the southern binary component is embedded in denser molecular material, consistent with previous studies that indicate a heavily reddened object. At this angular resolution any interaction between the two unresolved disk components cannot be disentangled. Higher resolution images are vital to understanding the process of star formation via rapid accretion FU Ori-type episodes.},

They are key to our understanding of the history of stellar mass assembly and pre-main sequence evolution, as well as critical to consider in the chemical and physical evolution of the circumstellar environment -- where planets form. A common supposition is that *all* T Tauri stars undergo repeated such outbursts, more frequently in their earlier evolutionary stages when the disks are more massive, so as to build up the requisite amount of stellar mass on the required time scale. However, the actual data supporting this traditional picture of episodically enhanced disk accretion are limited, and the observational properties of the known sample of FU Ori objects quite diverse. To improve our understanding of these rare objects, we outline the logic for meaningfully constraining the rate of FU Ori outbursts and present numbers to guide parameter choices in the analysis of time domain surveys.},

	abstract = {We present results from a suite of three-dimensional global hydrodynamic simulations which show that spiral density waves propagating in circumstellar disks are unstable to the growth of a parametric instability that leads to break-down of the flow into turbulence. This spiral wave instability (SWI) arises from a resonant interaction between pairs of inertial waves, or inertial-gravity waves, and the background spiral wave. The development of the instability in the linear regime involves the growth of a broad spectrum of inertial modes, with growth rates on the order of the orbital time, and results in a nonlinear saturated state in which turbulent velocity perturbations are of a similar magnitude to those induced by the spiral wave. The turbulence induces angular momentum transport, and vertical mixing, at a rate that depends locally on the amplitude of the spiral wave (we obtain a stress parameter \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}sim 5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ in our reference model). The instability is found to operate in a wide-range of disk models, including those with isothermal or adiabatic equations of state, and in viscous disks where the dimensionless kinematic viscosity \${\textbackslash}nu{\textbackslash}le 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$. This robustness suggests that the instability will have applications to a broad range of astrophysical disk-related phenomena, including those in close binary systems, planets embedded in protoplanetary disks (including Jupiter in our own Solar System) and FU Orionis outburst models. Further work is required to determine the nature of the instability, and to evaluate its observational consequences, in physically more complete disk models than we have considered in this paper.},

V346 Normae is a well-studied FUor that underwent a strong outburst beginning around 1980. Here, we report on photometric and spectroscopic observations, which show that the visual/near-infrared brightness has decreased dramatically between the 1990s and 2010 (ΔR ≈ 10.9 mag, ΔJ ≈ 7.8 mag and ΔK ≈ 5.8
mag). The spectral properties of this fading event cannot be explained by variable extinction alone, but indicate a drop in accretion rate by two to three orders of magnitude. This is the first time that a member of the FUor class has been observed to switch to a very low accretion phase. Remarkably, in the last few years (2011-2015) V346 Nor has brightened again at all near-infrared wavelengths, indicating the onset of a new outburst event. The observed behaviour might be consistent with the clustered luminosity bursts that have been predicted by recent gravitational instability and fragmentation models for the early stages of protostellar evolution. Given V346 Nor's unique characteristics (concerning outburst duration, repetition frequency and spectroscopic diagnostics), our results also highlight the need to revisit the FUor/EXor classification scheme.},

FU Ori systems demonstrate that disk accretion in early stellar evolution is highly episodic, varying from ∼ 10−7 yr−1 in the low (T Tauri) state to 10−4 yr−1 in the high (FU Ori) state. This variability in mass accretion is matched by a corresponding variability in mass ejection, with mass loss rates reaching ∼ 10−1 of the mass accretion rates in outburst. It appears that the FU Ori phenomenon is restricted to early phases of stellar evolution, probably with infall still occuring to the disk, which may help drive repetitive outbursts. Thermal instabilities are a promising way to produce FU Ori disk outbursts, although many uncertainties remain in the theory; triggering by interactions with companion stars on eccentric orbits may also play a role.},

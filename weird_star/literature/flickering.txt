Summary
-------
Previously to (Kenyon et al., 2000), there had not been flickering observed in a 
FU Ori. However, there *should* be flickering; it is present in most systems 
with luminous accretion disks. 

Kenyon et al. searched for flickering in historical light curve of FU Ori. Found 
small-amplitude fluctuations on timescales of <= 1 day. The star changed colour 
as it changed in brightness, indicating (?) variable source, optical colours of 
G0 supergiant. Characteristics of variation are similar to short-period 
interacting binary systems. Kenyon et al. somehow used characteristics of 
flickering to rule out sources of the variation, in favour of flickering at the 
inner edge of the accretion disk: temperatures between stellar temp. and 
maximum disk temp., ~7000K.

Observations
------------
60cm Zeiss reflector, 13" aperture, 27" when poor seeing
  uncertainty +/- 0.01-0.02 mag for V, +/- 0.02-0.04 mag for U-B
Maidanak High Altitude Observatory
  +/- 0.015 mag for V and V-R, +/- 0.02 mag for B-V, +/- 0.04-0.08 mag for U-B
Visual observations from AAVSO
  +/- 0.1-0.2 mag
  Comparison with photoelectric data: 20 day means over 7000 observations
    Reduces error to ~0.03 mag
    
Light curve analysis
--------------------
5-6 mag rise is recorded in blue filter
Then, decline ~1 mag over almost 70 yrs


Outburst model
--------------
Lines are fit to blue and AAVSO Visual historical light curves.
For blue, fit begging with outburst (although data is scarce)
For visual, no observations of outburst; line fit only to gradual dimming
To find fluctuation timescale in the next section, will use residuals from these

Fluctuation timescale
---------------------
Monte Carlo model: Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test
To compare artificial light curve with nonperiodic fluctuation (flickering). 
Best match: highest probability of being drawn randomly from the same 
distribution as data.
Observation frequency is ~1/day, 0.5/day, 0.333/day
Fluctuations must be <=1 day time scale based on success of the Monte Carlo 
model
They're flickering and not measurement error because of color variations:
  Fluctuations in V are accompanied by correlated variations in colour indices
  
Colour variations
----------------
There are considerable short term variabions, but no long-term variation
As source brightens, (B - V) redder and (V - R) bluer (this is robust)

Physical nature of light and colour variations
----------------------------------------------
Average colours are offset from standard stellar loci of F and G supergiants
Best match to changes in brightness and colour: G0 supergiant
Explanation for colour variations?
First, consider alternative explanations for colour variations, other than the 
accretion disk/flickering:
  Obscuration
    Small intervening dust cloud near star: popular model for other pre-MS
    Unlikely because: would need unusual particles for steep reddening law
    ***Photopolarimetry would test*** (read more if interested)
  Pulsation
    Amplitude similar to what we see
    ***5 hr period too short for these observations***
    BUT: FU Ori lies well above pre-MS instability strip in HR diagram
    AND: failed to detect any periodicity in FU Ori light curve
  Rotation
    Small amplitude, period 1-2 days plausibly produce similar variation
    Unlikely because in order to rotate fast enough, fast enough to break up
Instead, variations have a lot in common with flickering in other accreting 
systems: cataclysmic variables, low-mass X-ray binary systems
  Similar magnitude fluctuation in seconds to minutes, in inner disk
  Within each flicker, CV becomes bluer as it gets brighter
  Large colour temperature: flickering occurs in inner disk
  Lack of physical model in CV, but probes physical conditions
FU Ori variations plausibly at inner regions of accretion disk
  Time scale <=1 day, close to dynamical timescale of inner disk
  Temperature of variable source (~6000K for G0 supergiant) comparable to inner 
  disk temp. of 6500K
  Amplitude of variation similar to that observed in other accreting systems
  Therefore, FU Ori flickering
Alternative to flickering inner accretion disk:
  Magnetic accretion column
    Successful in other pre=MS stars
    But, FU Ori's variable source temp. of ~6000K is too cool
    
What can we learn about inner disk from variations?
Consider simple models for flickering
(will need to read again for more details if pursuing this)
Models where entire disk varies in brightness don't reproduce observations
Models with random flucuations in flux from any annulus also don't work
Instead:
Successful models allow only specific parts of the disk to vary in brightness
  Disk annuli w/ colours of F9-G1 supergiants vary:
    colour variation of model follows slope of observed colour variation
At odds with steady disk models:
  In those, disk temp. rises sharply from star, then decreases outward
  G0 temp of flickering sourcehas temp. of 6000K.
  Disk material with this temp has R=2.5 R(sun?) in steady model
  Fluctuations in energy output here, and lack of fluctuations in hotter disk, 
  unlikely. There should be larger variations at smaller disk radii
Inner regions of disks of FU Ori may be different than this simple disk model:
  Thicker
  Other disk models predict temp that peaks just outside photosphere:
    R=1.1-1.2(Rsun?)
  Decline in disk temp at smaller radii: 25%-50%
  So, disk temp. close to central star: 5000-6000K, closer to temp of 
  flickering source
  So, flickering source of FU Ori between photosphere and peak temp in disk
    This region produces ~5% of total light
    So, observable variations imply large changes in inner disk structure
    Data for FU Ori require 50% variations in light output of inner disk

So, ideas for research:
High-precision photometry of flickering -> physical conditions of inner disk
Large fluctuations in physical structure on short timescales
Theoretical models don't yet address rapid fluctuation like this

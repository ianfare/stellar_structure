Notes on FUors
(Mostly from https://www.aavso.org/vsots_fuori and constituent sources)

FU Orionis (original)
1937: from 16th magnitude, brightened by 6 magnitudes in 100-200 days
Bright nebulosity
Lingered at max brightness sence then, with nebula

Other stars exhibited similar dramatic increase in brightness

Many main-sequence stars likely originated as FUors
Many others have less dramatic brightness variations: T Tauri, EXors
Herbig 60s,70s: 
  FUors associated with dark clouds
  Similar spectra w/ high Li abundance, like T Tauri
  Rise in brightness is not a nova
  Likely Pre-MS, from event statistics
  
Kenyon 1999:
  coma-shaped reflection nebula, glowing in optical and near-IR
  Broad, blue-shifted (so, expelling material) Na I and H I absorption
  Optical line profiles change on month ~ year timescales
  Strong radio continuum sources, may be produced by outflow of a jet
  
FUors: pre-sun-like
  Common, but so brief that we haven't seen many
  Occur in dust and gas in active star-forming regions of the galaxy
  
Turner et al. 1997:
  Matter falling onto outer region of accretion disk from interstellar cloud
  Thermal instability in inner disk -> outburst
  Duration is determined by viscosity of hot, ionized inner disk
  Eruption declines when inner disk depleted by accretion
    -> T drops
    -> H can recombine
    -> Mass at inner disk increases again
    -> When T high enough to ionize H, cycle repeats
  Cycle between high & low accretion
  
  However, this can't be responsible for V346 Normae, which is too quick (ninan)

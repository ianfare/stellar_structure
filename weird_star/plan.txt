~~ super awesome plan ~~

Dividing between "Recent progress" vs. "Literature review"
----------------------------------------------------------

Literature review:
  "pertinent specifically to what you intend to do"
  "why your work is going to be impactful in the field"

  A discussion of small-scale flickering -> physical properties of accretion disk
    Because it's pertinent, effectively describing my methods

  A discussion of the current state of V346 Normae as of 2017
  Maybe also V899 Mon & second outbursts?

  In summary, the current state of the subject of research, and previous attempts at these methods

Recent progress:
  More general info on FU Ori stars
  Physical mechanisms and models of FU Ori stars
  Recent work on FU Ori stars in the general case?
  V899 Mon & second outbursts?


Fixes
-----

Talk as if FU Ori is the first to decrease in brightness and enter a second outburst
That's not true: V899 Mon (and others?)
Instead, refer to other second outbursts

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Abstract:
Outburst of Fu Ori stars is caused by rapid accretion.
At maximum, most light is emission from hot, optically thick accretion disk.
Accreted material is from a surrounding protostellar nebula, rather than 
a companion star: no radial velocity variations
Model: weak absorption lines should be double-peaked. Spectra of V1057 Cyg 
shows double-peaked profiles in red photospheric lines.
Massive winds from Fu Ori are from luminous disk surface
  Ejection from disk produces winds w/ appropriate geometry for bipolar outflow
  
Introduction:
Characteristics of Fu Ori:
  Increase (~5-6) of visual brightness, remain luminous for years/decades
  Peculiar spectra:
    Optical looks like rotating G supergiant
    Near-infrared looks like M star
Larson (1980): outburst energy from rapid rotation in early stellar evolutoin
  b/c progenitors are low-mass, pre-MS
Herbig 1977: subsurface nuclear reactions, strong magnetic fields
However, neither of these models accounts for peculiarities in a simple way
This paper:
  Accretion is responsible for FU Ori.
  Hot, optically thick accretion disk dominates observed spectrum
  Explains energy source for outburst, rise time of outburst, UV excess, M 
   spect. in infrared, colour evolution during decay from max light
  Predicts double-peaked profiles for photospheric lines
    (observations see that too)
    
Double peaked line profiles:

Wavelength dependence of line profiles:
Double peaks occur in red but not blue

    
Accretion disk model:
Explain outburst, wavelength dependence of spectrum, doubled profiles
Radial surface temp. gradient of disk -> wavelength dependence
Rotating disk -> double peaked line profiles
